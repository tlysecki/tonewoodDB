          <p>Tonewood Database gives you information about wood species to help you pick the best timbers for your guitars. You'll find technical information about density, native region and protection status alongside written descriptions of their tonal characteristics. While almost any deforestation is a bad thing, special notes will only be made of species that are being cut indiscriminately, sourced irresponsibly, or otherwise connected with poor practices.</p>
