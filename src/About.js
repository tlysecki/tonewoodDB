          <p>Tonewood Database gives you information about each type of wood to help you pick what suits your needs. You'll find technical information about density, native region and protection status alongside written descriptions of its tonal characteristics. While almost any deforestation is a bad thing, special notes will only be made of species that are being cut indiscriminately, sourced irresponsibly, or otherwise connected with poor practices.</p>
